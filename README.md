# snip-IT
A Code Snippet Manager CLI Tool

# General
- Create an array that will hold the different languages
    - Each language will hold a hashmap of file created containing the code snippets
- Data (code snippets) will be serialized into JSON to achieve persistence
- When the CLI tool starts up, data will be loaded into the array and hashmap for faster retrieval. When a snippet is added, it is loaded into the DS and then save the DS into JSON.

# TO-DO - 2023-08-16T13:40:03:
1. Create the serialization and flags
2. Create the Data Structure
3. Create the saving/loading
4. Implement Tview into the program (possibly)

# PS
This program will be used to practice DSA and Go channels. It will most likely be part of my resume as well:)
